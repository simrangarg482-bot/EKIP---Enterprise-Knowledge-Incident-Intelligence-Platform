"""Persistence for core/knowledge -- the proposal/review lifecycle over the
`documents` table (`app.database.models.ingestion_models.Document`,
`DocumentMetadata`).

Owned by: core/knowledge, for this lifecycle only. This is a deliberate,
flagged extension of `DATABASE_DESIGN.md`'s per-table single-writer
convention, not an oversight: that convention otherwise assigns `documents`
writes exclusively to `app.ingestion` (its connector-sync pipeline). This
module writes a disjoint code path instead -- every row it creates has
`source="manual"`, which `app.ingestion`'s connectors never produce and
never read -- so there is no real write conflict, only two legitimate
writers of the same table for two genuinely different reasons (automated
sync vs. human/agent-proposed content). `core/knowledge` cannot route
through `app.ingestion.repository`'s existing functions either way
(pyproject.toml's "core does not depend on mcp or ingestion" contract
forbids `core/` from importing `app.ingestion` at all), so issuing its own
queries directly against the shared ORM models is the only available
option, not a shortcut chosen over a cleaner one. This mirrors the
precedent `retrieval/` already set for *reading* this same table directly
(see `retrieval.schemas.ScoredChunk`'s docstring) -- extended here, for the
first time, to a second table *writer*.

`documents` has no dedicated `content` column: the model was shaped only to
identify/dedupe *ingested* content (`Document`'s own docstring), never to
store a manually-authored body. Rather than a schema migration -- out of
scope for wiring up an MCP tool, and this project's sandbox has no live
database to author/verify one against -- a proposed document's full text is
stored as a `document_metadata` row under the key `"content"`, reusing the
existing EAV table for a fact it wasn't originally shaped for. Flagged here
plainly: a dedicated `documents.content` column is the more correct
long-term fix, once a real migration can be written and tested.
